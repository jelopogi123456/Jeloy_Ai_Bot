You can test it on Google Collab if your RAM or GPU can't support tensorflow


Instructions: A.) Download: you can insert it to your VSCode Pycharm or Google Collab

1.) download the main.py, this is the training code for my bot 
2.) download the intents.py, this is the code that I made for every pattern and response of the bot
3.) download the chatbot.py, this is where you will run the chat bot.

B.) Install the libraries 
1.) to run the bot you will need to download the tensorflow,nltk,numpy you can do it by going to the command prompt
2.) type this 3 of the libraries on cmd :
pip install tensorflow 
pip install numpy   
pip install nltk 
 
3.) If there is still an error that you don't have tensorflow or numpy or nltk, it means that your VSC , Pycharm , Google collab 
is not yet installed so what will you going to do is: 
a.) In Pycharm Go to File----> Settings---->(The Project) ------> Python interpreter----> 
click the "+" ----> and type the following libraries ( tensorflow) and install it, after the tensorflow install the (numpy) 
after that install the (nltk) ------> and then apply 

b.) In VSC it's same, I use Pycharm so I don't know what is the process in VSC but you can look at the internet how to import the tensorflow, numpy, nltk into the project

C.) Running the bot
 Run the main.py first so it will get all the intents of the "intents.json" and it will train all of the patterns there.
 b.) then Run the chatbot if there is "Model Load Successfully" it means you can chat with my bot now!!
